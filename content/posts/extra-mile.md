A few years ago I started practicing crossfit and from the very first moment I knew that something special was about to happen, it was truly a game changer in the way I saw physical activity. I went from playing sports in a disorganised way (sometimes only once a week, other times going everyday to the gym including weekends) to practicing consistently 3 or 4 group classes per week with a structured plan and clear short and long term goals.

When I was in my first class, I saw on the chalkboard another section after the WOD (in a standard class the “workout of the day” is the final step) with a different set of exercises called "Extra Mile". Sometimes you had to run 2 or 3 km, others do some abs or practice your technique in some movement (i.e. rope climbing, rope jump, "double unders", etc). I asked one of the coaches what was the purpose of that and he told me that if I wanted to evolve faster/better I should do that extra mile. I wasn't obliged - "do it only if you have the time and motivation for it". But... I never had the time, as usual I was always in a rush to do something (either going to work when training early in the morning or going home to try and have dinner with my wife when practicing late in the afternoon) so I naturally skipped it on the first days, convinced that it was consequence of me being super busy and that doing only the class was enough.

However, after a couple of weeks I decided to give it a try. Can't recall exactly when or why, but maybe it was on a Saturday morning and I was a little bit more relaxed with personal/professional duties. "Run to the beach and return then you can go and take a shower". I did those extra 4 km, they "cost me" an extra half hour of my morning, then took a shower and went home. Next training the “dessert” was 100 abs. Then double unders skill training. Five minutes of planking. Max number of burpees in one minute. And I kept doing it every class for as long as I remember during the time I've been able to practice crossfit.

As the time passed by the extra mile was no longer "extra" but instead it became a part of the daily training/routine, all of that without needing to drastically change my schedule, just adapting the available time and restructuring my personal and others expectations. It’s not a problem if you get to work 15 minutes after the usual hour or start dinner a little bit later than the expected, what really counts is the fact that you get there with positivity and fully energized. That extra mile gave me both.

So, why does this even matter?

Well, this simple concept allowed me to become a better version of myself in less time. My overall performance improved, I started to reach the previously defined goals faster than it was originally expected and all of that wasn't just because of my consistency in training. That extra mile forced me to get out of my comfort zone as I had to give more than I thought I could give. It proved that with motivation, planning and structure you'll always find time to do what makes you feel and be better.

This is valid not only in sports but also in almost every other area of your personal and professional life. Find your motivations, build your goals on top of consistency and evolution will be a natural consequence. Use the extra mile to stand out!
